### Your challenge
Your task is to start building a simple version of this tiney app feature, either as a native app or web app, if preferred.
You might want to consider the following key user stories: 


### User stories

- [X] As a childcare provider, I’d like to be able to sign in or sign out a child with a single tap from this screen [#2][i2]
